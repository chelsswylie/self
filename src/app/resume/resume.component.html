  <h2>Grand Circus Graduate, June 2020</h2>
  <p id="GC">
    My professional career has frequently found me in positions where I have
    been the technical point of support for colleagures and clients alike. My
    drive to find the best technical solution for any given business need
    eventually drove me towards Software Development, and I enrolled in formal
    training at Grand Circus in January of 2020. Throughout this 6 month period,
    I expanded my knowledge in areas like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and started
    fresh when learning about the Angular Framework and using Web APIs.<br /><br />

    By the end of my time at Grand Circus, I was able to work with a group via
    GitHub to produce a fully functional Angular web application that
    incorporated multiple Web APIs. This application was a topic that we decided
    on as a group, and then took creative liberties to build the website in the
    way that we wanted it displayed. We divded this up primarily by components,
    each of us taking an independent approach to getting the functionality
    working, and reviewed with each other daily. I found our open communication
    to be the thing that made our project so successful. Please see below for my
    key projects:

    <h2>Central Michigan University, June 2015 Graduate</h2>
    <p id="CMU">
      In 2015, I earned my Bachelor of Arts in Music Performance from Central
      Michigan University. My primary instruments were the flute and guitar, and
      my performance degree is specialized in Flute Performance<br /><br />
      My degree included training in topics like Music Theory, Ear Training, and
      Music History. While we had some exposure to these topics at my
      highschool, most of the structured analysis of theory was new to me. I
      also spent 4 semesters studying the piano, and have learned how to
      accompany musicians on the piano.
